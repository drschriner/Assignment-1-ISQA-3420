#Executive Summary 

 
**Motivation** ~ *Why Was This System Designed*

The purpose of this assignment is to capture the internal perspective of a corporation receiving open source software from the external environment.  The Data Flow Diagram illustrates all the processes and databases that need to be designed in order to properly verify and store open source software.  Organizations must be inspect open source software to ensure they understand what the software does and the associated restrictions and permissions.  The Data Flow Diagram in this assignment puts procedures into place that will determine the license and vulnerability information for associated open source software.  All of this is necessary to avoid illegal use of open source software and to efficiently incorporate open source software into a business's proprietary software.

**Organizational Structure** ~ *Changes Within Organization*

From the implementation of this new system, changes within the organization will occur. Three new databases will have to be implemented within the company with accompanying resources to properly manage and protect the data. Additionally, the developer is now procuring external source code into the company, which is inheriting additional costs. Adjustment of organizational structure is paramount when companies engage in open source software because only one person is required to file a lawsuit. Therefore, to ensure the company is informed properly of the open source software they have received and potentially use, organizational changes will have to occur.


**Authority and Control** ~ *New Responsibilities*

As mentioned above, the developer has a new responsibility to submit open source software packages.  The developer and manager both have the ability to request information pertaining to a software package's license and vulnerability information.  Also, they both can request software policies that reveal which software packages violate license or vulnerability requirements.  The manager has the capability to modify existing policy documents or submit new software policy documents altogether.



**Social Responsibility** ~ *Impacts Beyond Organization*

By blending open source software with a company's own proprietary software it is very likely software projects will now be compromised of both types of software. For this reason, the organization will want to support the open source community they receive their source code from to ensure they do not go away.  Such support minimizes the company's chance of losing source code that is an integral part of their software projects, while avoiding the scenarios of finding alternative open source providers or maintaining the open source code in house.  However, our Data Flow Diagram does not depict any contributions back to open source communities.  Therefore, for the scope of this project the social responsibility of the organization is to release open source software that adherences to licenses and is well protected against vulnerabilities.  This will allow the developers within the open source community the opportunity to advance further and make additional improvements to the source code.
