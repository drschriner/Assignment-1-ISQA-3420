**Motivation** ~ *Why Was This System Designed*

The purpose of this assignment is to capture the internal perspective of a corporation receiving open source software from the external environment.  The Data Flow Diagram illustrates all the processes and databases that need to be designed in order to properly verify and store open source software.  Organizations must be thorough when they receive open source software, to ensure they understand what the software does and the associated restrictions and permissions.  The Data Flow Diagram in this assignment puts procedures into place that will determine the licenses and vulnerabilities information for associated open source software.  All of this is necessary to avoid illegal use of open source software and incorporate open source software into a business's proprietary software most successfully.  


**Organizational Structure** ~ *Changes Within Organization*

From the implementation of this new system, changes within the organization will occur. Three new databases will have to be implemented within the company with accompanying resources in order to properly manage and protect the data. Additionally, the developer is now procuring external source code into the company, which is inheriting additional costs. Adjustment of organizational structure is paramount when companies engage in open source software because only one person is required to file a lawsuit. Therefore, to ensure the company is informed properly of the open source software they receive and use, organizational changes will have to occur.


**Authority and Control** ~ *New Responsibilities*

As mentioned above, the developer has a new responsibility to submit open source software packages.  The developer and manager both have the ability to request information pertaining to a software package's license and vulnerability information.  Also, they both can request software policies that reveal which software packages violate license or vulnerability requirements.  The manager has the capability to modify existing policy documents or submit new software policy documents altogether.



**Social Responsibility** ~ *Impacts Beyound Organization*

By blending open source software with a company's own proprietary software, it is very likely software projects will now be compromised of both. That is why the organization will now have a responsibility to support the open source community they have receiving their code from to ensure they do not go away. The company does not want to be left with the options of finding alternative open source providers or maintaining the Open Source code in house. From this reason, the organization has a social responsibility to aid the open source community to minimize the chance of losing source code that is now an integral part of their software projects.
